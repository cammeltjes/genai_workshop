# Gen AI workshop

Do not follow the exact instructions but first follow the next steps.

## Task 1: Start up a new user-managed jupyter notebook
You do not have to change the existing settings

## Task 2: After creating the new notebook, click 'Open Jupyterlab'
Remark that is takes a minute or so to start up a new notebook. When it is done starting, you can press 'Open Jupyterlab'.

## Task 3: Initalize this git-repo
After opening the notebook, you see a tab on top 'git', with the option to 'Clone a repository'.
Enter the url of this github page: https://github.com/cammeltjes/genai_workshop.git

## Task 4: Run through the notebook
You should see the folder 'genai_workshop' appear in the left panel. 
Click on the folder and click on 'intro_prompt_design_workshop.ipynb'
Follow the steps of the notebook

## Task 5: Generic challenges to your own
These prompt strategies are still generic, they provide an overview of different options you have but it is more intersting to experiment with your own challenges.
Alter the notebook to your personal use case.

## Task 6: Done with the notebook?
Go back to the workbench (other tab!) and delete the just created notebook.
Now, you can open the 'generative-ai-jupyterlab' jupyterlab and deepen your knowledge with specific assignments.
The notebook has cloned a big repository with many examples and assignments. 
The folder 'language' within the 'generative-ai' folder has (for most use cases) the most relevant exercises but feel free to explore!
